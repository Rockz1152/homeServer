## Introduction

This media stack contains the following applications

- Dockhand - Dockhand a utility that helps automate the updating and management of your docker containers

- Gluetun - A VPN client in a container to securely route traffic from other apps through a VPN
- qBittorrent - A lightweight, open-source BitTorrent client for downloading and managing torrents
- Prowlarr - An indexer manager that connects your download apps to various torrent and Usenet sites, syncing all those "search locations" in one central place

## Server Setup

Requirements

- At least 20 GBs disk space needed
- At least 8 GBs of RAM

LXC Container Requirements

- Skip this section if you are installing on a VM or bare metal
- For LXC containers, pass-through the following devices:
  - `/dev/net/tun`
  - `/dev/dri/renderD128`
- If `id 1000` returns a user, use that user instead
- You must create a user for the docker containers to run as. Do not use the built-in root account.
  - Use `sudo useradd -s /usr/bin/bash -G sudo -m -u 1000 <username>` to create one if needed
    - This creates a user with a UID and GID of "1000", creates a home folder, sets their shell to bash, and adds them to the sudo group
  - Set a password for the new user `passwd <username>`

Once you have a user established, connect with SSH to your server

Create the following folder structure on the drive or network locations where you will be keeping your media and configs

- There are commands below the overview to quickly create the folders
```
data
├── config
│   ├── jellyfin-cache
│   └── jellyfin-config
├── downloads
└── media
    ├── movies
    └── shows
```

- First, navigate to the root folder of your storage location
```
cd /path/to/storage
```
- Create the folders
```
mkdir -p data/config/{jellyfin-cache,jellyfin-config}; \
mkdir -p data/downloads/; \
mkdir -p data/media/{movies,shows}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure your user is the owner of the data directory and it's sub folders.
>
> You may need to use `sudo chown <username>:<username> -R data` to take ownership of the files.
>
> Use `ls -la` to verify ownership.
>
> If the folders "jellyfin-cache" and "jellyfin-config" are not owned by your user, Jellyfin will fail to start.

## Dockhand
Install docker
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
```

Install Dockhand to simplify container management
```
sudo docker run -d \
  --name dockhand \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v dockhand_data:/app/data \
  fnsys/dockhand:latest
```

Visit your server IP address on port `3000` to open the web interface

### Dockhand Environments
Click `Go to Settings` to configure your local environment

- Click `+ Add environment`
- Name it `local`
- Under "Public IP" add the IP address of the server. e.g. `192.168.0.126`
- Click `+ Add`
- Lastly click `Test all`

### Manage Images
Pre-pull docker images to speed up building the stack
```
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/jellyfin/jellyfin; \
sudo docker pull qmcgaw/gluetun; \
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent; \
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/linuxserver/prowlarr; \
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr; \
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/linuxserver/radarr; \
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/linuxserver/sonarr; \
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/linuxserver/bazarr; \
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/seerr-team/seerr; \
sudo docker pull ghcr.io/dockur/samba;
```

Keeping images up-to-date

- Work-in-progress: https://github.com/Finsys/dockhand/issues/67
- For now, just run the above commands then manually stop and start the stack
- Keeping images up-to-date is necessary for containers such as Prowlarr and Flaresolverr in order to maintain indexer functionality

<!--
- Containers tab
  - Click `Check for updates` to see if there are any image updates available
- Stacks tab
  - Click `Pull images and restart`
- Images tab
  - Click `Prune unused` and confirm
  - This removes the old images to save disk space on the server
- Keeping images up-to-date is necessary for containers such as Prowlarr and Flaresolverr in order to maintain functionality
-->

### Update Dockhand

These commands will stop, update, prune, and start Dockhand
```
sudo docker stop dockhand; \
sudo docker pull fnsys/dockhand:latest; \
sudo docker start dockhand;
sudo docker image prune -f -a; \
```

<!--
- Open the containers tab and click `Check for updates`
- If an update for Dockhand is available, click `Update containers`
-->

## Building the Stack
Go to Stacks and select `+ Create`

- Give your stack a name at the top
  - _*Stack name must be lowercase, start with a letter or number, and contain only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores_
  - e.g. `media-server`
- Paste your compose file in the left side of the window
  - This is the contents of `mediaserver.yml`

Gluetun - VPN

- Visit https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/tree/main/setup/providers and select your VPN provider
- Depending on your provider, you may need to login to your VPN's web interface to retrieve Open VPN credentials and location data
  - For "Private Internet Access" you just use your current Username and Password
  - For "Windscribe" you'll need to login online and generate OpenVPN credentials
- Save this info in order to prepare your environment file in Dockhand next

Fill in your `.env` file

- To paste your `.env` file, you can either click `^ Load` button or change to edit mode by clicking the small document icon next to the words "Environment variables"
  - The file `.env.dist` contains a template of all the variables that need to be filled in
- "DATA_DIR" will be the path to your drive that media will be saved to. e.g. `/mnt/usb/data`
- Common Timezones:
  - America/New_York
  - America/Chicago
  - America/Denver
  - America/Phoenix
  - America/Los_Angeles
- Use `id <username>` to find your `uid` and `gid`, usually this is `1000` but yours may differ
- Under "Network Share Settings", you can change the name of the network share and specy the Username and Password to access it
- You must fill-in your VPN info into the Gluetun section or the container will restart over and over

Once you're ready, click the `Create & Start` button to deploy

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you start the stack it may produce an error in Dockhand. You may have to stop and start the stack once or twice for it to finish creating directories before it will start and stop without error.

- Run `sudo journalctl --unit docker -f` on the server to monitor for errors
- Startup time can vary from 1 to 3 minutes depending on hardware
